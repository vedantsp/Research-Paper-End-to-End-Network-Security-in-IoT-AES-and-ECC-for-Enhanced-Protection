# Research-Paper-End-to-End-Network-Security-in-IoT-AES-and-ECC-for-Enhanced-Protection

This research evaluates the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) as encryption techniques for enhancing end-to-end network security in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Given the exponential growth of IoT devices and their resource-constrained nature, selecting an encryption method that balances security, energy efficiency, and performance is paramount. Through a comprehensive literature review and the implementation of a simulated IoT testbed, this study compares AES and ECC in terms of encryption speed, energy consumption, and security robustness. The findings provide actionable insights for deploying optimal encryption methods in various IoT applications, addressing the challenges of securing critical infrastructure while maintaining device efficiency.
